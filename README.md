# 3rd Milestone project - Data Centric - Book Club

For this 3rd milestone project I'm creating an app with Flask based on a Book Club concept.
The admin of this app posts several weekly reading options than can of course be edited and deleted.
The admin will take suggestions for new books from Users.
Users will be able to login to their own profile page. From there they will be able to read all book suggestions featured in the app, 
They'll be able to like the content and post their own comments. They'll be able to see other users likes and comments.
They'll also be able to contact the admin and make suggestions for future weekly reads.

I encountered many problems following the old course videos for this Data Centric Module. I wasted a lot of time trying to work out the videos based on Cloud9, while I've been using Gitpod (as per the course instructions).
I finally got access to the new videos and I was able to follow the isntruction to connect to MongoDB and Heroku without any problems. 

## Techonologies

The Flask app is connected to the MONGODB noSQL and deployed on Heroku.
